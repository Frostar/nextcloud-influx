# Nextcloud-Influx

**VERY MUCH WORK IN PROGRESS!**

This is going to be a service that collects and send [serverinfo](https://github.com/nextcloud/serverinfo) data from Nextcloud instances to influxDB.
The goal is for this project to be as feature complete as the [original fork](https://github.com/janw/pi-hole-influx).
